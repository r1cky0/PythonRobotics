# PythonRobotics
Bachelor's degree thesis project at University of Pavia
## General overview
An autonomous navigation system allows a robot to move towards a specific destination in an environment characterized by the presence of obstacles.

In this project:
- geometrical maps
- coordinate system
- polygonal obstacles
## Objectives
- possibility to read any geometrical map
- creation of a graphs
- computation of the best path to move from start to goal
- 2D graphic simulation of the entire process
## Programming languages and tools
- Python
- Math, Mathplotlib and Numpy libraries
## Implemented algorithms
Creation of graphs:
- Visibility graph (both complete and reduced)
- Trapezoidal decomposition (possibility to change the coefficient of created segments)

Computation of the best path:
- A* (applicable to any graph)
## Simulations
